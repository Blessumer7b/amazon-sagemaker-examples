### Bring Your Own Model (XGboost)
`sagemaker-xgboost-bring-your-own-model.ipynb` shows how to train and Xgboost model in scikit-learn and then inject it into Amazon SageMaker's first party XGboost container for scoring. This addresses the use case where a customer has already trained their model outside of Amazon SageMaker, but wishes to host it for predictions within Amazon SageMaker.
