# Introduction to Applying Machine Learning

This directory includes introductory examples for applying machine learning to real world problems using Amazon SageMaker.  The notebooks tend to provide descriptive overviews rather than dense mathematical content to provide an easy on-ramp to using machine learning in common problems faced across a variety of industries.

Example Notebooks include:
- *linear_time_series_forecast*: Generate a time-series forecast for product demand using Amazon SageMaker's Linear Learner algorithm.
- *xgboost_customer_churn*: Predict customer churn by building a highly predictive gradient boosted trees model using Amazon SageMaker's implementation of the popular open source XGBoost package.
- *xgboost_direct_marketing*: Predict successful conversion of prospective customers using gradient boosted trees from Amazon SageMaker's implementation of the popular open source XGBoost package.
